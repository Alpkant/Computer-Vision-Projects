# Computer Vision BLG453E Projects
This repo is created for the my solutions to the Istanbul Technical University Computer Vision BLG453 Projects. There are 5 projects and you can see the project description pdfs and solution report in each repo. Furthermore, all requirements to run the programs are written inside of the each project repo. Homework 3 is partially implemented but other solutions are performing given task successfully. There can be lots of lots of improvements to made in the projects and this repo is open to the pull requests or code improvement advices.
